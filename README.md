# Ben-Smerd-Portfolio

## Introduction

Using create-react-app I was able to build a fully functioning client-side application that is my portfolio.

## Deployed URL

https://thebigbookman.github.io/Ben-Smerd-Portfolio/

## GitHub Repo

https://github.com/TheBigBookMan/Ben-Smerd-Portfolio

## Functionality

### Header

The header has a small profile picture with my name next to it on the left hand side and on the right hand side is the navigation bar.

### Navigation

The navigation bar has About Me, Projects, Contact and Resume. Clicking on each one will take the user to the respected page using React component state.

### Footer

The footer is another component that will stay at the bottom of the page and this hosts 3 icons- GitHub, Linkedin and Twitter. If the user clicks on any of them then my profile for each of those applications will open up in a new tab.

### Home/About Me

The home page is the About Me page that has two components- the left one has my bio that includes my profile picture enlarged, my name, a small bio, and my previous education. On the right hand side is a smaller component that contains relevant skills to the area of web development.

### Projects

Within the projects page there is two components- the component on the left contains 4 major projects that I worked on collaboratively and solo, with a small description of what the project is and a screenshot of the project, the user can click on the image and will be taken to the project repo. On the right hand side is a smaller component that has names of smaller projects that I worked collaboratively on or solo and these have small descriptions of the projects and then the user can click on the name to be taken to the repo for them.

### Contact

The contact page has one component where the user can input their name, email and a message and this will be sent to my email with an inquiry.
